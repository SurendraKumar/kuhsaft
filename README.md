# Kuhsaft

Kuhsaft provides an extendable backend Engine for rails apps similar but
much simpler than rails_admin. 

## Features

When you mount the Engine, you get:

* authentication with devise
* handling of multiple locales if you follow the conventions (TODO:
  Define conventions for locale handling)
* Backend Layout based on twitter bootstrap
* easy way to plug in your own models and use Kuhsaft as admin interface
  for them
